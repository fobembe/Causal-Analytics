# Causal Observational Analytics
The application of machine learning has gained much visibility in the field of causal analytics in the recent years. This project utilizes causalml package to understand the impact of promotion on performance of employees. 

From theoretical perspectives, good HRM practices leads to employee-centered outcomes such as motivation, job satisfaction, good organizational citizenship and commitment which can boost organizational-centered outcomes such retention, Increase in output and lower law suits leading to sustainable competitive advantage for the organization. However, not all employees respond to an incentive equally, that is why it is necessary to understand the psychometric characteristics of the employees with the aim of designing optimal HRM systems that will promote employee performance thereby realizing sustained competitive advantage inherent in human assets for the organization.

We utilize X-learner algorithm and causalml package to analyze the data, even though we cannot verify the autenticity of our dataset whether it is real or generated, it nevetheless provided a good opportunity to try out the causalml package which I thinkgave some good results.
